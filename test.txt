2.13    Additional Restrictions for Applications

A.      Use of the Apple Maps Service; Location
If Your Application uses or accesses the Map Kit API from a device running iOS version 6 or later, Your Application will access and use the Apple Maps Service.  All use of the Map Kit API and Apple Maps Service must be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and You agree that the Apple Maps Service is solely for use by Applications running on Apple-branded products.  Your Application may use the MapKit API only to access the Apple Maps Service and/or Map Data in Your Applications (except as otherwise set forth below).  

As part of such access to the Apple Maps Service and/or Map Data through the MapKit API:

-  Your Application must not remove, obscure or alter Apple’s or its licensors’ copyright notices, trademarks, or any other proprietary rights or legal notices, documents or hyperlinks that may appear in or be provided through the Apple Maps Service;

-  You must not use the Apple Maps Service in any manner that enables or permits bulk downloads or feeds of the Map Data, or any portion thereof, or that in any way attempts to extract, scrape or reutilize any portions of the Map Data.  For example, neither You nor Your Application may use or make available the Map Data, or any portion thereof, as part of any secondary or derived database;

-  Your Application may display the Map Data only as permitted herein, and when displaying it on a map, You agree that it will be displayed only on an Apple map provided through the Apple Maps Service; 

-  Except to the extent expressly permitted herein, You agree not to copy, modify, translate, create a derivative work of, publish or publicly display the Map Data in any way.  Further, You may not use or compare the data provided by the Apple Maps Service for the purpose of improving or creating another mapping service;

-  Unless otherwise expressly permitted in the MapKit Documentation for the Apple Maps Service, Map Data may not be cached, pre-fetched, or stored by You or Your Application, other than on a temporary and limited basis solely to improve the performance of the Apple Maps Service with Your Application; 

-  You acknowledge and agree that results You may receive from the Apple Maps Service may vary from actual conditions due to variable factors that can affect the accuracy of Map Data, such as road or weather conditions; and  

-  If Your Application accesses the MapKit API from a device running iOS version 5 or earlier, Your Application will access and use only the Google Mobile Maps (GMM) service.  Such use of the GMM is subject to the following terms: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/terms/iPhone.html.  If You do not accept such terms, You may not use the GMM service in Your Application, and You acknowledge and agree that such use will constitute Your acceptance of such terms.

Applications that use location-based APIs (e.g., Core Location, MapKit API) or otherwise provide location-based services may not be designed or marketed for automatic or autonomous control of vehicle behavior, or for emergency or life-saving purposes.  Map Data and other location data provided by Apple is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, delayed, non-existent, inaccurate or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage.  

If You choose to provide Your own location-based service, data and/or information in conjunction with the Apple maps provided through the Apple Maps Service (e.g., overlaying a map or route You have created on top of an Apple map), You are solely responsible for ensuring that Your service, data and/or information correctly aligns with any Apple maps used.  For Applications that use location-based APIs for real-time navigation (including, but not limited to, turn-by-turn route guidance and other routing that is enabled through the use of a sensor), You must have an end-user license agreement that includes the following notice:  YOUR USE OF THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.  Further, any Applications that offer location-based services or location-based functionality must notify and obtain consent from an individual before his or her location data is collected, transmitted or otherwise used by the Application.  

B.      Use of the HealthKit APIs and the HomeKit APIs
You may use the HealthKit APIs only for internal testing and development purposes for Your Application.  Your Application must not access the HealthKit APIs unless it is primarily designed to provide health and/or fitness services.  You must not use the HealthKit APIs, or any information obtained through the HealthKit APIs, to disclose or provide an end-user’s health and/or fitness information to any third party and may only use such APIs for internal testing and development purposes for Your Application.  If Your Application accesses NikeFuel points information through the HealthKit APIs, then Your use of the NikeFuel points information is subject to the NikeFuel points terms of service set forth at: https://developer.nike.com/healthkit/nikefuel-use-agreement.html.  If You do not accept such NikeFuel points terms of service, including, but not limited to all limitations and restrictions therein, You may not use such NikeFuel points information in Your Application, and You acknowledge and agree that such use will constitute Your acceptance of such terms of service.

You may use the HomeKit APIs only for internal testing and development purposes for Your Application.  Your Application must not access the HomeKit APIs unless it is primarily designed to provide home configuration or home automation services (e.g., turning on a light, lifting a garage door) for hardware accessories licensed under Apple’s MFi Program.  You agree not to use the HomeKit APIs for any purpose other than interfacing, communicating, interoperating with or otherwise controlling hardware accessories licensed under Apple’s MFi Program or for using the HomeKit database, and then only for home configuration or home automation purposes in connection with Your Application.  Your Application may use information obtained from the HomeKit APIs and/or the HomeKit database only on an Apple-branded product running iOS.  You agree not to export, remotely access, or transfer such information off such device (e.g., a lock password cannot be sent off an end-user’s device to be stored in an external non-Apple database). 

C.      Compliance with Laws
You agree that neither You nor Your Applications will disable, override or otherwise interfere with any Apple-implemented system alerts, warnings, display panels, consent panels and the like.  You understand and agree that You and Your Applications must comply with all applicable criminal, civil and statutory laws and regulations (including privacy, data collection and location service laws and regulations) in any jurisdictions in which Your Applications may be delivered.  You shall be solely responsible for, and Apple shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever with respect to, any and all claims, suits, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses arising from, related or attributable to, or otherwise involving Your Application. 

You agree not to use the Apple Software and Services for any unlawful or illegal activity, nor to develop any Application that would commit or facilitate the commission of a crime, or other tortious, unlawful, or illegal act.  You agree that, to the best of Your knowledge and belief, Your Applications will not violate, misappropriate, or infringe any Apple or third party copyrights, trademarks, rights of privacy and publicity, trade secrets, patents, or other proprietary or legal rights (e.g. musical composition or performance rights, video rights, photography or image rights, logo rights, third party data rights, etc. for content and materials that may be included in Your Application).  Further, You agree not to use the Apple Software or Apple Services to create any Application or other software program that would disable, hack or otherwise interfere with any security, digital signing, digital rights management, content protection, verification or authentication mechanisms implemented in or by the Apple Software or the Apple Services, or by other Apple software, services or technology, or enable others to do so, unless otherwise permitted by Apple in writing.

Applications must not contain any malware, malicious or harmful code, program, or other internal component (e.g. computer viruses, trojan horses, “backdoors”) and may not use any Apple Software or services in a way that could damage, destroy, or adversely affect Apple hardware, software or services, or any other software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, services, or networks.  If Your Application includes any FOSS, You agree to comply with all applicable FOSS licensing terms, and You agree not to use any FOSS in the development of Your Application in such a way that would cause the non-FOSS portions of the Provisioning Profiles, Apple Software, Services, or any Apple-issued certificates to be subject to any FOSS licensing terms or obligations.

3.      Pre-Release Software and Services
Note:  This Agreement applies to both the commercial release versions of the Apple Software and pre-release versions of the Apple Software, as applicable.  You should review the release notes provided with the Apple Software if You are uncertain about Your confidentiality obligations or visit developer.apple.com for more information about pre-release versions.  

3.1     Using Pre-Release Apple Software and Services 
Pre-release versions of the Apple Software or Apple Services should not be relied upon to perform in the same manner as a final-release, commercial-grade product, nor should they be used with data that is not sufficiently and regularly backed up.  The pre-release Apple Software and Apple Services may contain inaccuracies or errors that could cause failures or loss of data and may be incomplete.  You should back up Your data prior to using any pre-release Apple Software and Apple Services and not rely on them to perform in the same way as a commercial release of the Apple Software and Services.

3.2     Confidentiality
You agree that pre-release versions of the Apple Software and Apple Services (including pre-release Documentation) will be deemed “Apple Confidential Information”; provided however that upon the commercial release of the Apple Software and Apple Services, such pre-release versions of the Apple Software and Apple Services will no longer be confidential.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Apple Confidential Information will not include: (i) information that is generally and legitimately available to the public through no fault or breach of Yours, (ii) information that is generally made available to the public by Apple, (iii) information that is independently developed by You without the use of any Apple Confidential Information, (iv) information that was rightfully obtained from a third party who had the right to transfer or disclose it to You without limitation, or (v) any FOSS included in the Apple Software and Apple Services and accompanied by licensing terms that do not impose confidentiality obligations on the use or disclosure of such FOSS.  Further, Apple agrees that You will not be bound by the foregoing confidentiality terms with regard to technical information about pre-release Apple Software or Apple Services disclosed by Apple at WWDC (Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference), except that You may not post screen shots of, write public reviews of, or redistribute any pre-release Apple Software or Services.

You agree to protect Apple Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care that You use to protect Your own confidential information of similar importance, but no less than a reasonable degree of care.  You agree to use Apple Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising Your rights and performing Your obligations under this Agreement and agree not to use Apple Confidential Information for any other purpose, for Your own or any third party’s benefit, without Apple's prior written consent.  You further agree not to disclose or disseminate Apple Confidential Information to anyone other than: (i) Authorized Developers; or (ii) as otherwise agreed or permitted in writing by Apple.  You may disclose Apple Confidential Information to the extent required by law, provided that You take reasonable steps to notify Apple of such requirement before disclosing the Apple Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment of the Apple Confidential Information.  You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of Apple Confidential Information may be irreparable; therefore, Apple is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.

4.      Indemnification 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Apple, its directors, officers, employees, independent contractors and agents (each an “Apple Indemnified Party”) from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including without limitation attorneys' fees and court costs) (collectively “Losses”) incurred by an Apple Indemnified Party as a result of Your breach of this Agreement, a breach of any certification, covenant, representation or warranty made by You in this Agreement, any claims that Your Applications violate or infringe any third party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or otherwise related to or arising from Your use of the Apple Software and Apple Services, Your Applications, Your development of Applications, or Your loading of Applications and limited distribution as permitted hereunder.  You acknowledge that the Apple Software and Apple Services is not intended for use in the development of Applications in which errors or inaccuracies in the content, functionality, services, data or information provided by the Application or the failure of the Application could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage, and, to the extent permitted by law, You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Apple Indemnified Party from any Losses incurred by such Apple Indemnified Party by reason of any such use.  In no event may You enter into any settlement or like agreement with a third party that affects Apple's rights or binds Apple in any way, without the prior written consent of Apple.

5.      Term and Termination
The license to use this version of the Apple Software and Apple Services is effective until terminated as set forth herein.  

This Agreement and all rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically or cease to be effective without notice from Apple if You or any of Your Authorized Developers fail to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement.  All rights hereunder in any beta or pre-release versions of the Apple Software for a particular release will terminate upon the commercial release of such Apple Software.  

Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, You agree to immediately cease all use of the Apple Software and Apple Services and erase and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Apple Software and Apple Services and all copies of Apple Confidential Information in Your and Your Authorized Developers' possession or control.  At Apple’s request, You agree to provide written certification of such destruction to Apple.  

Apple reserves the right to revoke, disable or suspend any Provisioning Profiles or any access to the device deployment and provisioning features of the Apple Software and Services at any time, in its sole discretion.  By way of example, Apple may do this if Apple has reason to believe that Apple IDs were fraudulently obtained, that an unreasonable number of devices have been entered into the Apple Software, and/or that the Services are being used in a fraudulent, suspicious, or improper manner.   

The following terms shall survive termination: Section 1, the last sentence of Section 2.1, the last two sentences of Section 2.2B., the second to last sentence of Section 2.4, Section 2.6, Section 2.7, the last sentence of 2.12, and Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  Apple will not be liable for compensation, indemnity, or damages of any sort as a result of terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy Apple may have, now or in the future. 

6.      NO WARRANTY
A.      YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, USE OF THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND APPLE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. 

B.      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND APPLE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS “APPLE” FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 6 AND 7) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND APPLE SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

C.      APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND APPLE SERVICES, THAT THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND APPLE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND APPLE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS IN THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND APPLE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND APPLE SERVICES WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH FUTURE APPLE PRODUCTS OR SOFTWARE.  INSTALLATION OF THIS APPLE SOFTWARE AND USE OF THE APPLE SERVICES MAY AFFECT THE USABILITY OF THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY SERVICES AS WELL AS OTHER APPLE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

D.      YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND APPLE SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR USE IN SITUATIONS OR ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THE FAILURE OR TIME DELAYS OF, OR ERRORS OR INACCURACIES IN THE CONTENT, DATA OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY, THE APPLE SOFTWARE OR APPLE SERVICES COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS. 

E.      NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE WILL CREATE A WARRANTY.  SHOULD THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND APPLE SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

7.      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA OR INFORMATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLE SOFTWARE AND APPLE SERVICES, OR YOUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  In no event shall Apple’s total liability to You under this Agreement for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

aqaan场景1：当你改乱了工作区某个文件的内容，想直接丢弃工作区的修改时，用命令git checkout -- file。

场景2：当你不但改乱了工作区某个文件的内容，还添加到了暂存区时，想丢弃修改，分两>步，第一步用命令git reset HEAD <file>，就回到了场景1，第二步按场景1操作。

场景3：已经提交了不合适的修改到版本库时，想要撤销本次提交，参考版本回退一节，不>过前提是没有推送到远程库
